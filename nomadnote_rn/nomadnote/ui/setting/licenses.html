      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

    <div class="license">
      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,

      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.

      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>

      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and

      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM

      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates

      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      <p><strong>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</strong><br />
        Version 2, June 1991</p>

      <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
        51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA</p>

      <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
        of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

      <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>

      <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the
        GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
        the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
        Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
        Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
        programs, too.</p>

      <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
        designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
        service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
        software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

      <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
        to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
        copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>

      <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
        recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
        And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

      <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives
        you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>

      <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
        warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
        recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not
        reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>

      <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
        redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
        proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
        not licensed at all.</p>

      <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>

      <p><strong>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>

      <p><strong>0</strong>. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the
        copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program",
        below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
        derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
        verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
        without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>

      <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside
        its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
        its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
        Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>

      <p><strong>1</strong>. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it,
        in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright
        notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of
        any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

      <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
        protection in exchange for a fee.</p>

      <p><strong>2</strong>. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work
        based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,
        provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the
          date of any change.</p>

        <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
          from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the
          terms of this License.</p>

        <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
          running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
          appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
          warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view
          a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
        from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
        License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
        distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
        whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
        and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

      <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
        you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
        based on the Program.</p>

      <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based
        on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
        this License.</p>

      <p><strong>3</strong>. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
        code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
        following:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
          the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>

        <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge
          no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
          corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
          used for software interchange; or,</p>

        <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.
          (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
          object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an
        executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
        interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
        However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
        distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
        operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>

      <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
        offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
        code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

      <p><strong>4</strong>. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
        provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
        void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
        copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
        remain in full compliance.</p>

      <p><strong>5</strong>. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing
        else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
        prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
        work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
        conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>

      <p><strong>6</strong>. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient
        automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
        these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
        rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>

      <p><strong>7</strong>. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any
        other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
        License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any
        other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a
        patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
        directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
        refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>

      <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance
        of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

      <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or
        to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
        free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
        generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
        application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
        software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

      <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
        License.</p>

      <p><strong>8</strong>. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by
        patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
        may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
        permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation
        as if written in the body of this License.</p>

      <p><strong>9</strong>. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public
        License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
        detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

      <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this
        License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
        either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does
        not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
        Foundation.</p>

      <p><strong>10</strong>. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose
        distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
        copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
        for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
        free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>

      <p><strong>NO WARRANTY</strong></p>

      <p><strong>11</strong>. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO
        THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
        OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
        BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
        RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
        ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

      <p><strong>12</strong>. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT
        HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
        FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
        INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
        LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN
        IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

      <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
      <!-- START OF 'HOW TO APPLY' SECTION -->

      <p><strong>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</strong></p>

      <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
        achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

      <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
        file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
        line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br />
          Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</p>

        <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General
          Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your
          option) any later version.</p>

        <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
          implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License
          for more details.</p>

        <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to
          the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

      <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for
          details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
          type `show c' for details.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public
        License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could
        even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>

      <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
        disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
          compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>

        <p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br />
          Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>

      <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your
        program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
        the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>

      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.

      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,

      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>

      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you

    <p>Terms and conditions</p>
    <input type="checkbox"><label></label>
    <div class="license">
      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

        separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
        the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a

      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE

      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>

      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

    <div class="license">
      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.

      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a

      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)

      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at

      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

    <div class="license">
      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND

      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be

    <p>Terms and conditions</p>
    <input type="checkbox"><label></label>
    <div class="license">
      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF

      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>

      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

    <div class="license">
      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

      This is the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      1.1 The Android Software Development Kit (referred to in the License Agreement as the "SDK"
      and specifically including the Android system files, packaged APIs, and Google APIs add-ons)
      is licensed to you subject to the terms of the License Agreement. The License Agreement
      forms a legally binding contract between you and Google in relation to your use of the SDK.

      1.2 "Android" means the Android software stack for devices, as made available under the
      Android Open Source Project, which is located at the following URL:
      http://source.android.com/, as updated from time to time.

      1.3 A "compatible implementation" means any Android device that (i) complies with the
      Android Compatibility Definition document, which can be found at the Android compatibility
      website (http://source.android.com/compatibility) and which may be updated from time to
      time; and (ii) successfully passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS).

      1.4 "Google" means Google LLC, a Delaware corporation with principal place of business at
      1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States.


      <h3>2. Accepting this License Agreement</h3>
      2.1 In order to use the SDK, you must first agree to the License Agreement. You may not use
      the SDK if you do not accept the License Agreement.

      2.2 By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the License Agreement.

      2.3 You may not use the SDK and may not accept the License Agreement if you are a person
      barred from receiving the SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries,
      including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the SDK.

      2.4 If you are agreeing to be bound by the License Agreement on behalf of your employer or
      other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your
      employer or such entity to the License Agreement. If you do not have the requisite
      authority, you may not accept the License Agreement or use the SDK on behalf of your
      employer or other entity.


      <h3>3. SDK License from Google</h3>
      3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a limited, worldwide,
      royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK
      solely to develop applications for compatible implementations of Android.

      3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other platforms (including
      non-compatible implementations of Android) or to develop another SDK. You are of course free
      to develop applications for other platforms, including non-compatible implementations of
      Android, provided that this SDK is not used for that purpose.

      3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to
      the SDK, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual
      Property Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law,
      trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights. Google reserves all rights not
      expressly granted to you.

      3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by the License
      Agreement. Except to the extent required by applicable third party licenses, you may not
      copy (except for backup purposes), modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer,
      disassemble, or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.

      3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK licensed under an open
      source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open source software
      license and not the License Agreement.

      3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides may change without
      prior notice to you and that future versions of the SDK may be incompatible with
      applications developed on previous versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop
      (permanently or temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you or to
      users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.

      3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names,
      trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.

      3.8 You agree that you will not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices
      (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the
      SDK.


      <h3>4. Use of the SDK by You</h3>
      4.1 Google agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors)
      under the License Agreement in or to any software applications that you develop using the
      SDK, including any intellectual property rights that subsist in those applications.

      4.2 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes that are permitted by
      (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted
      practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the
      export of data or software to and from the United States or other relevant countries).

      4.3 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for general public users, you
      will protect the privacy and legal rights of those users. If the users provide you with user
      names, passwords, or other login information or personal information, you must make the
      users aware that the information will be available to your application, and you must provide
      legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your application stores
      personal or sensitive information provided by users, it must do so securely. If the user
      provides your application with Google Account information, your application may only use
      that information to access the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
      which, the user has given you permission to do so.

      4.4 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK, including the
      development or distribution of an application, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or
      accesses in an unauthorized manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of
      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.

      any third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier.

      4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any data, content, or resources that you create, transmit or
      display through Android and/or applications for Android, and for the consequences of your
      actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.

      4.6 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no responsibility to
      you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations under the License Agreement,
      any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or
      regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any third
      party may suffer) of any such breach.


      <h3>5. Your Developer Credentials</h3>
      5.1 You agree that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer
      credentials that may be issued to you by Google or which you may choose yourself and that
      you will be solely responsible for all applications that are developed under your developer
      credentials.


      <h3>6. Privacy and Information</h3>
      6.1 In order to continually innovate and improve the SDK, Google may collect certain usage
      statistics from the software including but not limited to a unique identifier, associated IP
      address, version number of the software, and information on which tools and/or services in
      the SDK are being used and how they are being used. Before any of this information is
      collected, the SDK will notify you and seek your consent. If you withhold consent, the
      information will not be collected.

      6.2 The data collected is examined in the aggregate to improve the SDK and is maintained in
      accordance with Google's Privacy Policy.


      <h3>7. Third Party Applications</h3>
      7.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party or that access data,
      content or resources provided by a third party, you agree that Google is not responsible for
      those applications, data, content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
      resources which you may access through such third party applications are the sole
      responsibility of the person from which they originated and that Google is not liable for
      any loss or damage that you may experience as a result of the use or access of any of those
      third party applications, data, content, or resources.

      7.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to you through such a
      third party application may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by
      the providers (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
      lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on these data, content, or
      resources (either in whole or in part) unless you have been specifically given permission to
      do so by the relevant owners.

      7.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications, data, content, or
      resources may be subject to separate terms between you and the relevant third party. In that
      case, the License Agreement does not affect your legal relationship with these third
      parties.


      <h3>8. Using Android APIs</h3>
      8.1 Google Data APIs

      8.1.1 If you use any API to retrieve data from Google, you acknowledge that the data may be
      protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by Google or those parties that
      provide the data (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). Your use of any such
      API may be subject to additional Terms of Service. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan,
      sell, distribute or create derivative works based on this data (either in whole or in part)
      unless allowed by the relevant Terms of Service.

      8.1.2 If you use any API to retrieve a user's data from Google, you acknowledge and agree
      that you shall retrieve data only with the user's explicit consent and only when, and for
      the limited purposes for which, the user has given you permission to do so. If you use the
      Android Recognition Service API, documented at the following URL: <a
        href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService">https://developer.android.com/reference/android/speech/RecognitionService</a>,
      as updated from time to time, you acknowledge that the use of the API is subject to the Data
      Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor, which is located at the
      following URL: <a
        href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/gdprprocessorterms/</a>,
      as updated from time to time. By clicking to accept, you hereby agree to the terms of the
      Data Processing Addendum for Products where Google is a Data Processor.


      <h3>9. Terminating this License Agreement</h3>
      9.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Google as
      set out below.

      9.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by ceasing your use of the
      SDK and any relevant developer credentials.

      9.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you if:
      (A) you have breached any provision of the License Agreement; or
      (B) Google is required to do so by law; or
      (C) the partner with whom Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
      terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain parts of the SDK to you;
      or
      (D) Google decides to no longer provide the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the
      country in which you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision of the
      SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's sole discretion, no longer
      commercially viable.

      9.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
      liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued
      over time whilst the License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to continue
      indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7
      shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.


      <h3>10. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
      10.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND
      THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FROM
      GOOGLE.

      10.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE
      OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE
      TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.

      10.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.


      <h3>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
      11.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GOOGLE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, AND
      ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,
      INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY
      YOU, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN
      ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.


      <h3>12. Indemnification</h3>
      12.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold
      harmless Google, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and
      agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any
      and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
      fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) your use of the SDK, (b) any application you
      develop on the SDK that infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress,
      patent or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any person or violates
      their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you with the License
      Agreement.


      <h3>13. Changes to the License Agreement</h3>
      13.1 Google may make changes to the License Agreement as it distributes new versions of the
      SDK. When these changes are made, Google will make a new version of the License Agreement
      available on the website where the SDK is made available.


      <h3>14. General Legal Terms</h3>
      14.1 The License Agreement constitutes the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
      governs your use of the SDK (excluding any services which Google may provide to you under a
      separate written agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you and
      Google in relation to the SDK.

      14.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which
      is contained in the License Agreement (or which Google has the benefit of under any
      applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that
      those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.

      14.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any
      provision of the License Agreement is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the
      License Agreement without affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining
      provisions of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.

      14.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Google is
      the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other
      companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the License
      Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other
      person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.

      14.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
      YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY
      TO THE SDK. THESE LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.

      14.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned or transferred by
      either you or Google without the prior written approval of the other party. Neither you nor
      Google shall be permitted to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the
      License Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

      14.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under the License Agreement,
      shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
      laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
      located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any legal matter arising
      from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google shall still be
      allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in
      any jurisdiction.
